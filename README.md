This is an internal app for Urbarium.org, useful for managing bonos and a very simple user management. It is a React app which includes some Atlaskit components, built on top of [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

A live demo is available at https://urbarium-admin-react.urbarium.now.sh

## Getting started

Please make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) installed in your system.

Please run the following commands to clone the project, install dependencies and start the application.

```bash
git clone https://bitbucket.org/atlassian/atlaskit-starter.git   # clone the project
yarn install  # install dependencies
yarn start  # start the project
```

Alternatively, we have a Storybook of React components. 

```bash
yarn run storybook
```

## Want some help?

This repository is helpful for people using a build with Atlaskit + React + Redux for the first time, including technologies like Firebase, Zeit Now, Sentry & Log Rocket. If you find a bug or require an improvement, please report it:
